# Task 02: Keep Status as Simple Strings - COMPLETED

## Summary of Changes

Successfully maintained the simple string-based status system:

1. **Removed TODO comment** in `models.py`
   - Was suggesting to use an Enum
   - Replaced with documentation of valid values

2. **Added clear documentation**
   - Status field now documented with valid values: "setup", "running", "completed", "error", "cancelled"
   - No complex type system needed

3. **Verified no enums in use**
   - Searched entire codebase
   - Confirmed all status values are simple strings
   - No enum imports or definitions found

## Result

The status system remains simple and effective:
- Plain strings that serialize naturally to JSON
- No imports needed to use status values
- Clear documentation of valid values
- Easy for any developer to understand

## No Changes Needed

The codebase was already following the "simple strings" approach. This task was mainly about:
1. Removing the suggestion to add complexity (the TODO comment)
2. Documenting the current approach
3. Confirming no unnecessary enums were added

The system works well as-is with simple string values.
