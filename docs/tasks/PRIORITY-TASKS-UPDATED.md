# Priority Tasks for Math Agent System - UPDATED

## Current State Assessment

We've successfully completed:
- ‚úÖ Removed unnecessary complexity (DI, lifespan managers)
- ‚úÖ Kept status as simple strings
- ‚úÖ Added basic error handling throughout
- ‚úÖ **Priority 1: Tested job executor core functions** 
- ‚úÖ **Priority 2: Fixed test environment - all tests now pass**

## üìù Priority 3: Basic Usage Documentation

**No clear documentation** on how to actually use the system.

### Task: Create Simple README
- How to start the server
- How to submit a job  
- How to use the mock executor for demos
- What the system actually does

**Why**: Even simple code needs basic usage docs.

## üîß Priority 4: Verify Job Execution Flow

**The core flow is untested** end-to-end.

### Task: Manual Testing Guide
- Document how to manually test job creation
- Document expected behavior
- Create test data/exercises if missing

**Why**: Need to verify it actually works before automation.

## üéØ Priority 5: Clean Up Warnings

**Minor issues to address**:
- Fix datetime deprecation warnings (use UTC-aware datetimes)
- Remove old warning comments in test files
- Update test descriptions that reference "UNTESTED" code

**Why**: Professional codebase shouldn't have warnings.

## What We've Accomplished

### Testing Coverage
- **Job Executor**: 10 comprehensive tests covering all critical paths
- **API Endpoints**: 14 tests covering all routes and error cases  
- **Test Environment**: Properly isolated with fixtures
- **Execution Time**: All 24 tests run in < 0.3 seconds

### Code Quality
- Simple, understandable architecture
- Robust error handling
- No complex abstractions
- Clear separation of concerns

## Next Step

Continue with **Priority 3** - create basic usage documentation so people know how to actually use the system.
