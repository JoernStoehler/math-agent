# Task 01: Remove Unnecessary Complexity - COMPLETED

## Summary of Changes

Successfully simplified the codebase by removing dependency injection and complex patterns:

1. **Created simple config module** (`src/math_agent/config.py`)
   - Simple module-level constants for paths
   - No dependency injection needed

2. **Deleted dependencies.py**
   - Removed entire DI framework
   - No more type aliases or complex functions

3. **Simplified main.py**
   - Removed lifespan context manager
   - Job manager initialized at module level
   - Simple middleware to start job manager on first request
   - No more factory functions

4. **Updated all route files**
   - Import paths directly from config module
   - Import job_manager from app_state module
   - No more dependency injection parameters

5. **Extracted mock executor**
   - Created `scripts/mock_executor.py` as standalone script
   - Run separately when needed for demos
   - Not part of main application

## Result

The codebase is now much simpler:
- Any developer can understand the flow in minutes
- No "magic" or hidden complexity
- Direct imports and simple functions
- Clear separation of concerns

## Next Steps

The other tasks (02-04) should be evaluated to see if they still apply after this simplification.
