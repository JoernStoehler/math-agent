# Task 01: Test Job Executor Core Functions - COMPLETED

## Summary

Successfully added comprehensive tests for the JobExecutor class - the critical component that was completely untested.

## What Was Done

### 1. **Extracted Command Building Logic**
- Refactored command building into `_build_command()` method
- Made it testable without running the full execution flow

### 2. **Created Core Tests**
- **Command Building**: Tests for both Claude and Gemini models with/without disallowed tools
- **Status Updates**: Tests loading and updating job status files
- **Log Streaming**: Tests JSON output streaming and handling of invalid output
- **Execution Flow**: Tests both success and error scenarios
- **Job Cancellation**: Tests process termination

### 3. **Test Infrastructure**
- Added `pytest-asyncio` to dev dependencies for async test support
- Used proper mocking to avoid external dependencies
- Tests run in under 0.1 seconds

## Test Coverage

The tests now cover:
- ✅ Command building for different models
- ✅ Status file operations with error handling
- ✅ Log streaming from process output
- ✅ Complete execution flow (success and failure)
- ✅ Job cancellation
- ✅ Error scenarios (missing files, invalid JSON)

## Results

```
10 tests passed in 0.04s
```

All critical paths in the JobExecutor are now tested without requiring:
- Real AI agent executables
- API keys
- External processes
- PDF compilation

## Impact

The job executor is no longer "COMPLETELY UNTESTED". We now have confidence that:
1. Commands are built correctly for both Claude and Gemini
2. Status updates work as expected
3. Log streaming handles both valid and invalid output
4. Error conditions are handled gracefully

## Next Steps

With the core executor tested, we can now:
- Fix the test environment for API tests (Task 02)
- Remove the warning comments about untested code
- Consider testing job creation flow once API tests work
