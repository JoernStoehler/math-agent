# Refactoring Tasks Overview

## Task Dependencies and Execution Order

### Phase 1: Foundation (Can be done in parallel)
These tasks are independent and can be started immediately:

- **Task 01: Flatten Module Structure** - This is the foundation that most other tasks depend on
- **Task 02: Explicit Status Enum** - Simple, isolated change
- **Task 08: Add Proper Testing** - Can start with existing structure

### Phase 2: Core Refactoring (After Task 01 is merged)
These tasks depend on the new module structure from Task 01:

- **Task 03: Dependency Injection** - Needs the new structure
- **Task 04: Separate Route Concerns** - Needs the new structure
- **Task 05: Storage Abstraction** - Needs the new structure
- **Task 06: Config Management** - Needs the new structure

### Phase 3: Final Polish (After Phase 2)
- **Task 07: Simplify Entry Point** - Depends on multiple Phase 2 tasks

## Recommended Approach

1. **Start with Phase 1 tasks only** (01, 02, 08)
2. **After Task 01 is merged**, create worktrees for Phase 2 tasks
3. **After Phase 2 is mostly complete**, create worktree for Task 07

## Current Worktrees Created

We've created worktrees for all tasks, but you should:
1. Only start agents on Phase 1 tasks (01, 02, 08) immediately
2. Leave Phase 2 worktrees idle until Task 01 is merged
3. Consider removing Phase 2/3 worktrees and recreating them later:
   ```bash
   agent-worktree remove refactor/03-dependency-injection
   agent-worktree remove refactor/04-separate-route-concerns
   agent-worktree remove refactor/05-storage-abstraction
   agent-worktree remove refactor/06-config-management
   agent-worktree remove refactor/07-simplify-entry-point
   ```

## Task Prioritization

1. **Task 01** is the highest priority as it unblocks most other work
2. **Task 02** and **Task 08** can proceed in parallel with Task 01
3. Once Task 01 is merged, all Phase 2 tasks can proceed in parallel
4. Task 07 should be done last as it benefits from all previous refactoring
