# Refactoring Tasks: Making It Boring

## Goal
Make this codebase so simple and standard that any Python developer can understand and maintain it without documentation.

## Principles
- **Boring is good** - use the most obvious solution
- **Explicit over implicit** - no magic, no cleverness
- **Simple over flexible** - we don't need flexibility we're not using
- **Standard over optimal** - use patterns everyone knows

## Tasks

### Task 01: Remove Unnecessary Complexity
Remove dependency injection, complex lifecycle management, and other over-engineered patterns. Just use simple constants and direct function calls.

### Task 02: Keep Status as Simple Strings  
Don't add an enum for 5 status values. Strings work fine.

### Task 03: Simple Error Handling
Add basic try/except where needed. No custom exception hierarchies.

### Task 04: Basic Tests That Matter
Test the critical paths (job executor) with simple, readable tests.

## What We're NOT Doing
- ❌ Dependency injection
- ❌ Abstract base classes
- ❌ Complex type hierarchies
- ❌ 100% test coverage
- ❌ Clever abstractions
- ❌ Premature optimization

## Success Metrics
- A new developer can understand the entire codebase in 30 minutes
- Changes take minutes, not hours
- No "magic" that requires deep knowledge
- Boring, predictable, maintainable code
