# Task 02: Fix Test Environment - COMPLETED

## Summary

Successfully fixed the test environment so all API tests now run properly.

## What Was Done

### 1. **Created Test Fixtures** (`conftest.py`)
- `test_dirs`: Creates temporary directory structure with test data
- `mock_job_manager`: Provides AsyncMock for job manager
- `test_app`: Patches configuration and creates test app instance
- `client`: Provides TestClient for API testing

### 2. **Fixed Module Import Issues**
- Clear sys.modules before patching to force reimport
- Patch config values BEFORE importing the app
- Disable startup middleware that would interfere with tests

### 3. **Rewrote All API Tests**
- Replaced skipped tests with working implementations
- Added comprehensive coverage for all endpoints:
  - GET endpoints (jobs, exercises, prompts, models)
  - POST endpoints (create job, save prompt, cancel job)
  - Error cases (404s, 400s, duplicates)

## Results

```
24 tests passed in 0.27s
```

All tests now run successfully:
- 10 job executor tests âœ…
- 14 API endpoint tests âœ…
- 0 skipped tests ðŸŽ‰

## Key Improvements

1. **Isolated Test Environment**: Tests use temporary directories, not production data
2. **Proper Mocking**: Job manager is mocked to avoid side effects
3. **Fast Execution**: All tests complete in under 0.3 seconds
4. **No External Dependencies**: No need for real AI agents or API keys

## Technical Details

The solution required:
- Removing modules from sys.modules to force clean reimport
- Patching at the module level before any imports
- Using AsyncMock for async job manager methods
- Creating test data in fixtures for predictable results

The test environment is now properly isolated and all API functionality is verified.
