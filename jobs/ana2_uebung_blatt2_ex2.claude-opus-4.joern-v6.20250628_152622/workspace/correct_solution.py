# The integral is ∫_0^π sin²(x)/(sin(x)+cos(x)) dx
# This integral has a singularity at x = 3π/4 where sin(x) + cos(x) = 0

# Let's use a different approach. We know that:
# sin(x) + cos(x) = √2 sin(x + π/4)

# Also, let's use the identity:
# sin²(x) = (1 - cos(2x))/2

# But actually, let's solve it using complex analysis or a clever trick.
# Here's a known technique: for integrals of the form ∫_0^π f(sin x, cos x) dx,
# we can sometimes use the substitution t = tan(x/2) for x ∈ [0,π)

# However, as we found, this leads to a divergent integral because of the pole.

# Let's interpret this as a principal value integral.
# The integrand has a simple pole at x = 3π/4.

# Near x = 3π/4, we have:
# sin(x) + cos(x) ≈ √2 sin(x + π/4) ≈ √2 sin(3π/4 + π/4 - 3π/4 + x)
#                = √2 sin(π + x - 3π/4) = -√2 sin(x - 3π/4)
#                ≈ -√2(x - 3π/4) for x near 3π/4

# So near the pole:
# sin²(x)/(sin(x)+cos(x)) ≈ sin²(3π/4)/(-√2(x - 3π/4)) = (1/2)/(-√2(x - 3π/4)) = -1/(2√2(x - 3π/4))

# The residue at x = 3π/4 is:
# Res = lim_{x→3π/4} (x - 3π/4) * sin²(x)/(sin(x)+cos(x))

x = sp.Symbol('x')
f = sp.sin(x)**2 / (sp.sin(x) + sp.cos(x))

# Calculate residue
x0 = 3*sp.pi/4
residue = sp.limit((x - x0) * f, x, x0)
print("Residue at x = 3π/4:", residue)

# For principal value, we can use Sokhotski–Plemelj theorem
# But let's just compute it directly

# Actually, let's use a contour integration approach
# or notice that we can rewrite the integral

# Alternative: Use the fact that
# ∫_0^π f(x) dx = ∫_0^(π/2) [f(x) + f(π-x)] dx

# f(π-x) = sin²(π-x)/(sin(π-x)+cos(π-x)) = sin²(x)/(sin(x)-cos(x))

# So our integral becomes:
# ∫_0^(π/2) [sin²(x)/(sin(x)+cos(x)) + sin²(x)/(sin(x)-cos(x))] dx
# = ∫_0^(π/2) sin²(x) * [(sin(x)-cos(x) + sin(x)+cos(x))/((sin(x)+cos(x))(sin(x)-cos(x)))] dx
# = ∫_0^(π/2) sin²(x) * [2sin(x)/(sin²(x)-cos²(x))] dx
# = ∫_0^(π/2) 2sin³(x)/(-cos(2x)) dx

# Let's verify this numerically
