# I need to be more careful about the calculation
# The issue is that F(0) itself gives the answer, not F(∞) - F(0)

# Let me reconsider. The integral after substitution is:
# ∫₀^∞ 8t²/[(1+t²)²(-t²+2t+1)] dt with a pole at t = 1+√2

# The antiderivative is:
# F(t) = -(t+1)/(t²+1) - √2/4 * ln|t-(1+√2)| + √2/4 * ln|t-(1-√2)| + arctan(t)

# For the principal value, we compute:
# lim[ε→0] [∫₀^(1+√2-ε) + ∫_(1+√2+ε)^∞]
# = lim[ε→0] [F(1+√2-ε) - F(0) + F(∞) - F(1+√2+ε)]

# Near the singularity, F has a log singularity that cancels in the principal value
# So P.V. = F(∞) - F(0)

# But wait, I think I misunderstood the limits
# Let me recalculate F(0) properly

t = sp.Symbol('t', real=True)

# At t = 0:
# arctan(0) = 0
# -(0+1)/(0²+1) = -1
# For the log terms, we need |0-(1+√2)| = 1+√2 and |0-(1-√2)| = √2-1

# So F(0) = -1 + 0 - √2/4 * log(1+√2) + √2/4 * log(√2-1)
#         = -1 + √2/4 * [log(√2-1) - log(1+√2)]
#         = -1 + √2/4 * log[(√2-1)/(1+√2)]

# Now (√2-1)/(1+√2) = (√2-1)/(1+√2) * (1-√2)/(1-√2) = (√2-1)(1-√2)/[(1+√2)(1-√2)]
#                    = (√2-1)(1-√2)/(1-2) = -(√2-1)(1-√2) = -(√2-2√2+1) = -(1-√2)² 
#                    = -[1-2√2+2] = -(3-2√2) = 2√2-3

# Actually, let me be more careful:
# (√2-1)/(1+√2) = (√2-1)(1-√2)/[(1+√2)(1-√2)] = (√2-1)(1-√2)/(1-2) = -(√2-1)(1-√2)

# (√2-1)(1-√2) = √2 - 2 + 1 - √2 = -1
# So (√2-1)/(1+√2) = -(-1)/(-1) = -1

# Wait, that's not right. Let me compute it directly:
ratio = (sqrt(2) - 1)/(1 + sqrt(2))
ratio_simplified = simplify(ratio)
print("(√2-1)/(1+√2) =", ratio_simplified)
print("Numerical =", float(ratio_simplified))

# So F(0) = -1 + √2/4 * log(ratio)

# At t = ∞:
# arctan(∞) = π/2
# -(∞+1)/(∞²+1) → 0
# The log difference → 0

# So F(∞) = π/2

# Actually, I realize the issue. When I wrote the antiderivative, I need to be careful about
# which branch of the logarithm to use for t < 1-√2, 1-√2 < t < 1+√2, and t > 1+√2

# For 0 < t < 1+√2, we have t-(1+√2) < 0, so ln|t-(1+√2)| = ln((1+√2)-t)
# For 0 < t, we have t-(1-√2) > 0 (since 1-√2 < 0), so ln|t-(1-√2)| = ln(t-(1-√2))

# Let me just use the numerical value we computed: 1.6232252401402305
# And find what combination of π, e, ln(2), √2 gives this

val = 1.6232252401402305

# Some attempts:
print(f"\nNumerical value: {val}")
print(f"π/2 = {float(pi/2)}")
print(f"π/2 + ln(1+√2)/2 = {float(pi/2 + log(1+sqrt(2))/2)}")
print(f"π/2 + ln(√2)/2 = {float(pi/2 + log(sqrt(2))/2)}")

# Let me check if the answer involves the silver ratio
silver = 1 + sqrt(2)
print(f"\nSilver ratio (1+√2) = {float(silver)}")
print(f"ln(1+√2) = {float(log(silver))}")

# Try some combinations
print(f"π/2 + ln(1+√2)/2/√2 = {float(pi/2 + log(1+sqrt(2))/(2*sqrt(2)))}")

# Actually, based on the antiderivative, the answer should be:
# P.V. = π/2 - (-1 + √2/4 * log((√2-1)/(1+√2)))
#      = π/2 + 1 - √2/4 * log((√2-1)/(1+√2))
#      = π/2 + 1 + √2/4 * log((1+√2)/(√2-1))

# Now (1+√2)/(√2-1), let's rationalize:
# (1+√2)/(√2-1) * (√2+1)/(√2+1) = (1+√2)(√2+1)/[(√2-1)(√2+1)]
#                                = (1+√2)(√2+1)/(2-1) = (1+√2)(√2+1)
#                                = √2 + 1 + 2 + √2 = 3 + 2√2

final_answer = pi/2 + 1 + sqrt(2)/4 * log(3 + 2*sqrt(2))
print(f"\nFinal answer: π/2 + 1 + √2/4 * ln(3+2√2)")
print(f"Numerical: {float(final_answer)}")

# This doesn't match. Let me reconsider...
# I think the issue is with how I'm handling the principal value

# Actually, the correct answer appears to be:
pv_correct = 1 + sqrt(2)/4 * log(3 + 2*sqrt(2)) - pi/2
print(f"\n1 + √2/4 * ln(3+2√2) - π/2 = {float(pv_correct)}")

# Still not matching. Let me check one more combination:
# The numerical value 1.6232... might be:
attempt = pi/2 + (sqrt(2)-1)/2 * log(1 + sqrt(2))
print(f"\nπ/2 + (√2-1)/2 * ln(1+√2) = {float(attempt)}")

# After much calculation, the exact value appears to be non-elementary
# or involves special functions. The numerical value is approximately 1.623225...
