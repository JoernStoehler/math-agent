% Draft solution for the exercise

% Key definitions:
% - A curve f:[a,b] → ℝⁿ is rectifiable if its length L(f) is finite
% - L(f) = sup{P_f(t_0,...,t_k) | partitions of [a,b]}
% - P_f(t_0,...,t_k) = Σ_{i=1}^k ||f(t_i) - f(t_{i-1})||

% Part (a): 
% Need to show:
% 1. f|_{[a,c]} and f|_{[c,b]} are rectifiable
% 2. L(f) = L(f|_{[a,c]}) + L(f|_{[c,b]})

% Strategy: 
% - Use that any partition of [a,b] containing c can be split into partitions of [a,c] and [c,b]
% - Show both directions of the equality

% Part (b):
% This seems like it should follow from the definition of L(f)
% Need to verify that the supremum formula holds

% Part (c):
% The converse: if the supremum is finite, then f is rectifiable
% This is essentially showing that the definition is well-posed
