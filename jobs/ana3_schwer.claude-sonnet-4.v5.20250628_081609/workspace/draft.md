# Draft Solution

## Key Concepts:
1. A manifold M is a topological space that locally looks like R^n
2. A chart is a homeomorphism φ: U → V where U ⊂ R^n is open and V ⊂ M is open
3. Lebesgue measure on manifolds can be defined using charts
4. A set has Lebesgue measure zero if it can be covered by countably many sets of arbitrarily small measure

## Problem Analysis:
We need to show that for any manifold M, there exists a single chart φ: U → M such that M \ φ(U) has Lebesgue measure zero.

## Initial Thoughts:
- This seems counterintuitive at first - usually we need multiple charts to cover a manifold
- But the key is that we don't need to cover ALL of M, just "almost all" in the measure-theoretic sense
- The complement M \ φ(U) can be non-empty but must have measure zero

## Strategy:
1. Use the fact that M is second countable (standard assumption for manifolds)
2. Consider a countable atlas {(U_i, φ_i)}
3. Use measure theory to show we can find one chart that covers almost everything

Wait, I need to be more careful about what "Lebesgue measure" means on a manifold...

## Refined Understanding:
- For a manifold M of dimension n, we can define Lebesgue measure using charts
- If (U, φ) is a chart with φ: U → M, then for A ⊂ φ(U), we define μ(A) = λ^n(φ^{-1}(A)) where λ^n is n-dimensional Lebesgue measure
- A set E ⊂ M has Lebesgue measure zero if for every chart (U, φ), the set φ^{-1}(E ∩ φ(U)) has Lebesgue measure zero in R^n

## Key Insight:
The statement is actually quite strong - it says we can find ONE chart whose image misses only a null set of M. This is related to the fact that:
1. M is σ-compact (can be written as countable union of compact sets)
2. We can use a countable atlas and measure theory arguments

## Proof Approach (Revised):
Actually, this is a subtle result. Let me think more carefully...

The issue is that just because M = ∪ V_i doesn't mean one of the V_i covers almost all of M.

## Better Approach:
I think the key is to use:
1. The fact that M admits a smooth structure
2. Whitney embedding theorem: Any smooth n-manifold can be embedded in R^{2n}
3. Sard's theorem and related results about measure

Actually, I realize I need to be very careful here. The statement as given might need additional assumptions or might be referring to a specific construction.

## Most Likely Interpretation:
The statement is probably true under certain conditions:
- M is a smooth manifold
- M is second countable
- We're considering a measure compatible with the smooth structure

The proof would likely involve:
1. Using that M has a countable dense subset
2. Constructing a special chart using this dense subset
3. Showing the complement has measure zero by a covering argument
